Many updates enabling tests to pass on CRAN, after the package was removed due to failing tests.

I have made fixes (to DESCRIPTION and package size) to address the issues raised by CRAN.

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.1.0
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.1.0
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
