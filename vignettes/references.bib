  abstract = {Semi-structured focus group interviews were employed to examine factors that affect the likelihood that resource managers in southern Africa will use information on vegetation fires provided by two satellite-derived products: an active fire product and a burned area product. The two products are updated regularly and aim to deliver the state-of-the-art in the global monitoring of fires from satellite remote-sensing. Both products are derived from data transmitted by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors carried onboard NASA's Aqua and Terra satellites. The active fire product can be accessed for free via the internet and on media by users working anywhere in the world; the burned area product will be accessible in a similar manner in 2006. The MODIS fire products provide systematic, near-global coverage and are freely available; as such, they give resource managers new opportunities to obtain or supplement information they need to manage vegetation fires effectively. However, the availability of these products does not mean that resource managers will use them, and many other factors are involved. To understand factors that affect whether southern African resource managers will use the two products, two focus groups were held with members of the Southern African Fire Network (SAFNet) in Malawi, Africa, August 2004. Analysis of the group discussions reveals a number of factors that influence whether they will use the products. The qualitative, in depth nature of the group discussions revealed 12 main factors that influence product use; not least the low international internet bandwidths for African countries outside of South Africa. Analysis of the group discussions also suggests how the uptake of MODIS fire products by resource managers in southern Africa might be enhanced by affecting specific changes to how MODIS products are packaged and delivered.},

  abstract = {The location of new housing developments, and the provision of safe space for walking and cycling to key destinations around them, have major and long lasting impacts on travel behaviour, health, and environmental outcomes. Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is a well-recognised concept in urban planning, but systemic evidence is often lacking on the likely ‘active travel performance’ of new developments, making it hard for the planning process to support sustainable transport objectives. This paper articulates the concept of
‘Active Travel Oriented Development’ (ATOD) and describes methods for operationalising it. We demonstrate the use of a set of simple metrics to assess the active travel performance of new and proposed development sites. ATOD has the benefits of building on the established concept of TOD and being easy to assess. We conclude that ATOD, and tools for measuring it, are needed to ensure that transport and development policies work in harmony.},

  abstract = {The detection of colocation pattern is an important and widely used method to analyze the spatial associations of geographical objects and events. Existing studies primarily focus on discovering colocation patterns and association rules based on point data. A broad range of flow data types, such as population flow, logistics, and information flow, have emerged in recent years. However, colocation patterns and association rules based on flow data are difficult to detect because of their complex structure. This work proposes a colocation pattern detection and spatial association rule discovery approach that treats origin-destination (OD) flow as Boolean spatial features, while considering the spatial proximity of the origins and destinations of OD flows and its direction similarity. The effectiveness of this approach is verified by an artificial data set. Finally, this work analyzes the data of tourists who are traveling from different countries or regions to diverse cities in China. It also proves the application value of the proposed approach, which has general applicability to the mining of colocation patterns and association rules from any type of OD flow data.},

The net effect of open-space proximity is theoretically uncertain because the positive externalities associated with proximity such as a view or nearby recreation facility might be outweighed by negative externalities, for example, traffic congestion and noise. The impact of open-space proximity and type is examined empirically using a data set that includes the sales price for homes in Portland, Oregon, a major metropolitan area in the United States, geographic information system derived data on each home’s proximity to an open-space and open-space type, and neighborhood and home characteristics. Results show that proximity to an open-space and open-space type can have a statistically significant effect on a home’s sale price. These estimates provide an important step in quantifying the overall benefit from preserving open spaces in an urban environment.},

  abstract = {In the same way that discrete global grid systems (DGGS) are used to index data on the spherical Earth, they can aggregate point data, with their spherical polygons serving as bins. DGGS are particularly useful at multiple map scales because they are spatially hierarchical and exist on the sphere or ellipsoid, allowing large or small scale binning without projection distortion. We use DGGS in a free and open-source pedagogical tool for teaching students about the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). Our software application uses Dutton’s quaternary triangular mesh (QTM) to bin global data points geodesically with counts or measures of any theme at multiple levels. Users can interactively select the level to which the data are binned by the QTM, as well as translate the whole tessellation east or west so that points fall into and out of different bins. These two functions illustrate the scaling and zoning aspects of the MAUP with dynamically-drawn choropleths on the surface of a virtual globe that the user can zoom and rotate, allowing visualization at virtually any cartographic scale. Users may also select various quantile classifications to further explore issues in visualizing aggregate data. In addition to presenting this new tool, we highlight the importance, especially at smaller scales, of using geodesic point-in-polygon intersection detection, rather than the projected 2D methods typically used by geographic information systems.},

The condition of two-phase flow was simulated with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model, taking into consideration turbulence effects using the k-e model. The results showed that there is a strong dependency of the flow behaviour on the mesh employed.

To do this, data obtained from Statistical Centre of Iran for 2006 and 2011 is provided in sub-district level, the smallest geographical unit. Results revealed that monocentric model is not able to explain the spatial distribution of employment in TMR; also, the main core loses its importance with the passage of time. Applying different methodologies for TMR identified 3 subcenters in 2006; whereas, it reached to 7 subcenters in 2011. In the last step, the deployed polycentric employment function explained 42\% and 51\% of total employment distribution throughout TMR in 2006 and 2011 respectively.},

To prevent this kind of sprawl in future, it is necessary to monitor the growth of the city. Hence, an attempt has been made in the present study to monitor the urban growth over a period of time by employing Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques in conjunction with Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is a measure to determine the compactness or dispersion of built-up land growth in the urban areas. The growth patterns of urban built-up land have been studied initially by dividing the area into four zones. The observations have been made with respect to each zone. Then, the study area has been divided into concentric circles of 1 km buffers and the growth patterns have been studied based on urban built-up density with respect to each circular buffer in all four zones. These observations have been integrated with road network to check the influence of infrastructure on haphazard urban growth. It has been found from the study that Shannon entropy is a good measure to determine the spatial concentration or dispersion of built-up land in the city. The study also proved the potential of RS and GIS techniques in the spatio-temporal analysis of urban growth trends and their consequences in the lands adjoining to urban areas.},

  abstract = {At least three levels of control are required to operate most vehicles: (1) inner-loop control to counteract the momentary effects of disturbances on vehicle position; (2) intermittent maneuvers to avoid obstacles, and (3) outer-loop control to maintain a planned route. Operators monitor dynamic optical relationships in their immediate surroundings to estimate momentary changes in forward, lateral, and vertical position, rates of change in speed and direction of motion, and distance from obstacles. The process of searching the external scene to find landmarks (for navigation) is intermittent and deliberate, while monitoring and responding to subtle changes in the visual scene (for vehicle control) is relatively continuous and 'automatic'. However, since operators may perform both tasks simultaneously, the dynamic optical cues available for a vehicle control task may be determined by the operator's direction of gaze for wayfinding. An attempt to relate the visual processes involved in vehicle control and wayfinding is presented. The frames of reference and information used by different operators (e.g., automobile drivers, airline pilots, and helicopter pilots) are reviewed with particular emphasis on the special problems encountered by helicopter pilots flying nap of the earth (NOE). The goal of this overview is to describe the context within which different vehicle control tasks are performed and to suggest ways in which the use of visual cues for geographical orientation might influence visually guided control activities.},

  abstract = {Landscape ecologists often deal with aggregated data and multiscaled spatial phenomena. Recognizing the sensitivity of the results of spatial analyses to the definition of units for which data are collected is critical to characterizing landscapes with minimal bias and avoidance of spurious relationships. We introduce and examine the effect of data aggregation on analysis of landscape structure as exemplified through what has become known, in the statistical and geographical literature, as theModifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). The MAUP applies to two separate, but interrelated, problems with spatial data analysis. The first is the “scale problem”, where the same set of areal data is aggregated into several sets of larger areal units, with each combination leading to different data values and inferences. The second aspect of the MAUP is the “zoning problem”, where a given set of areal units is recombined into zones that are of the same size but located differently, again resulting in variation in data values and, consequently, different conclusions. We conduct a series of spatial autocorrelation analyses based on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to demonstrate how the MAUP may affect the results of landscape analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the broader-scale implications for the MAUP in landscape ecology and suggest approaches for dealing with this issue.},

  abstract = {Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure and other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the right places, such as along ‘desire lines’ of high latent demand. This creates the need for tools and methods to help answer the question ‘where to build?’. Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based ‘cycling futures.’ Four scenarios are presented, including ‘Go Dutch’ and ‘Ebikes,’ which explore what would happen if English people had the same propensity to cycle as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level for each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of scenarios and deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.},

  abstract = {Studies of forest dynamics plots (FDPs) have revealed a variety of negative density-dependent (NDD) demographic interactions, especially among conspecific trees. These interactions can affect growth rate, recruitment and mortality, and they play a central role in the maintenance of species diversity in these complex ecosystems. Here we use an equal area annulus (EAA) point-pattern method to comprehensively analyze data from two tropical FDPs, Barro Colorado Island in Panama and Sinharaja in Sri Lanka. We show that these NDD interactions also influence the continued evolutionary diversification of even distantly related tree species in these FDPs. We examine the details of a wide range of these interactions between individual trees and the trees that surround them. All these interactions, and their cumulative effects, are strongest among conspecific focal and surrounding tree species in both FDPs. They diminish in magnitude with increasing phylogenetic distance between heterospecific focal and surrounding trees, but do not disappear or change the pattern of their dependence on size, density, frequency or physical distance even among the most distantly related trees. The phylogenetic persistence of all these effects provides evidence that interactions between tree species that share an ecosystem may continue to promote adaptive divergence even after the species’ gene pools have become separated. Adaptive divergence among taxa would operate in stark contrast to an alternative possibility that has previously been suggested, that distantly related species with dispersal-limited distributions and confronted with unpredictable neighbors will tend to converge on common strategies of resource use. In addition, we have also uncovered a positive density-dependent effect: growth rates of large trees are boosted in the presence of a smaller basal area of surrounding trees. We also show that many of the NDD interactions switch sign rapidly as focal trees grow in size, and that their cumulative effect can strongly influence the distributions and species composition of the trees that surround the focal trees during the focal trees’ lifetimes.},

  abstract = {A majority of statistical methods used in the analysis of land use and transportation systems implicitly carry the assumption that relationships are constant across locations or individuals, thus ignoring contextual variation due to geographical or socio-economic heterogeneity. In some cases, where the assumption of constant relationships is questionable, market segmentation procedures are used to study varying relationships. More recently, methodological developments, and a greater awareness of the importance of geography, have led to increasingly sophisticated ways to explore varying relationships in land use and transportation modeling. The objective of this paper is to propose a simple probit model to explore contextual variability in continuous-space. Some conceptual and technical issues are discussed, and an example is presented that reanalyzes land use change using data from California’s BART system. The results of the example suggest that considerable parametric variation exists across geographical space, and thus underlines the relevance of contextual effects.},

The algorithm performed as well as an architect on 77\% of offices, and achieved a higher capacity in an additional 6\%, all while following a set of space standards. If the algorithm used the space standards the same way as an architect (a more relaxed interpretation), the algorithm achieved a 97\% match rate, which means that the algorithm completed this design task as well as a designer and in a shorter time. The benchmarking of a layout algorithm against thousands of existing designs is a novel contribution of this article, and we argue that it might be a first step toward a more comprehensive method to automate parts of the office layout process.},

Our vegetation model improves techniques from procedural ecosystem generation and neutral landscape modeling. It is able to generate diverse ecological sound plant distributions directly from landscape maps with statistical ecological data. Our visualization model integrates existing level of detail and illumination techniques to achieve interactive frame rates and improve realism. We validated with ecology experts the outcome of our framework using two case studies and concluded that it provides convincing interactive visualizations of large natural environments.},

Our tool enables exploring designs that passively lower flood depth everywhere or mostly in chosen key areas. Our approach tightly integrates a hydraulic model and a parameterized urban generation system with an optimization engine so as to find the least cost modification to an initial urban layout design. Further, due to the computational cost of a fluid simulation, we train neural networks to assist with accelerating the design process.

In this study, we describe different paths each type of standardized data takes to construct isoplethic surfaces in a cartographic modeling framework. As suggested in previous research, an area-based pycnophylactic interpolator is preferred to point interpolators in isopleth mapping not only because it preserves the total volume in each aggregation unit but also because it is non-parametric and is able to incorporate ancillary data to increase the accuracy of a surface representation. Here, a general pycnophylactic method is used to generate isopleth maps of density surfaces, but a hybrid approach is proposed to address the small denominator problem that arises when mapping ratio/rate and proportion/percentage surfaces. Finally, we propose a value-by-perspective height mapping procedure to resolve the visual equalization problem associated with ratio/rate and proportion/percentage surfaces that enable one to distinguish among high rate/large denominator, high rate/small denominator, low rate/large denominator, and low rate/small denominator regions of the surface.},

This paper compares four such strategies, namely, ‘random’, ‘regular’, ‘proportional-stratified’ and ‘equal-stratified’—to investigate (1) how they affect prediction accuracy and (2) how sensitive they are to sample size. In order to compare them, a virtual species approach (Ecol. Model. 145 (2001) 111) in a real landscape, based on reliable data, was chosen. The distribution of the virtual species was sampled 300 times using each of the four strategies in four sample sizes. The sampled data were then fed into a GLM to make two types of prediction: (1) habitat suitability and (2) presence/absence. Comparing the predictions to the known distribution of the virtual species allows model accuracy to be assessed. Habitat suitability predictions were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and presence/absence predictions by Cohen's κ agreement coefficient. The results show the ‘regular’ and ‘equal-stratified’ sampling strategies to be the most accurate and most robust. We propose the following characteristics to improve sample design: (1) increase sample size, (2) prefer systematic to random sampling and (3) include environmental information in the design.},

With a gridded population dataset and geographic boundary of the study area, GridSample allows a two-step process to sample “seed” cells with probability proportionate to estimated population size, then “grows” PSUs until a minimum population is achieved in each PSU. The algorithm permits stratification and oversampling of urban or rural areas. The approximately uniform size and shape of grid cells allows for spatial oversampling, not possible in typical surveys, possibly improving small area estimates with survey results.},

Location sampling has remained a poorly understood technique through its confusion with area sampling, and there has been a consequent failure to grapple with the problems of stratifying by location when the primary sampling items are of varying areal extent or are irregularly spaced. An objective method of stratifying by location employing minimal aggregation is described and is used as a basis for both systematic and random samples. Tests on locationally stratified farm sample designs, based upon certain known and hypothetical farm characteristics in one New South Wales shire, indicate that increases in sampling precision obtained through locational stratification are directly related to the levels of spatial segregation in the items being sampled.},

Classic urban form visualizations – from Giambattista Nolli’s ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs’s figure-ground diagrams of city streets – have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric.

  abstract = {THE PERSISTENCE OF THE GERRYMANDER IN NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING Douglas M. Orr, Jr.* One of the most important special geographic units below the state level is that established for conducting elections. The determination of one type of electoral unit, the congressional district, is a matter of considerable conse­ quence to our federal system of government as manifested in the United States House of Representatives—’’the grand depository of the democratic principle.” Yet in our supposedly democratic form of government, congres­ sional districts have traditionally been subject to enormous population disparities and gerrymandering. Political power is rarely surrendered volun­ tarily. A political “rule of the game” has been that the party or interest in power apportioned and redistricted so as to stay in power. North Carolina has been no exception. Among its 21 congressional district plans over the past 180 years, including three realignments since 1960, the gerrymander had helped perpetuate the rural domination of the state’s congressional delegation, and mor§ recently, it has been used to try to stem the rising tide of Republicanism and return Democratic incumbents to office. North Carolina therefore provides a meaningful case study as to the persistence of a tactic that has too long prevailed with the nation’s political system. GERRYMANDERING. The practice of gerrymandering actually began in Europe, but the term itself originated in 1812 in Massachusetts when Governor Elbridge Gerry carved out an electoral district that was said to resemble a salamander due to its winding shape (Fig. 1). The corruption of the two words gave American politics this descriptive term. This art of political cartography has not been confined to one group or region; both political parties in most parts of the country have practiced it. It represents the manipulation of district boundries in order to juggle district populations for partisan advantage. However, considerable misconception exists con­ cerning the gerrymander. A gerrymandered district may not always be identified by its shape, in spite of the common connotation of the term. The one vote requirement, for example, can be considered an “anti-gerrymandering ” development because it prevents the inequities of overpopulated and underpopulated districts which were motivated often by party strength in such districts. Yet population equality does not completely prevent gerry­ mandering, although it does restrict partisan maneuvering. The gerrymander may therefore be manifested in several forms, and this art of political abuse has become quite refined by more than a century of *Dr. Orr is assistant professor of geography at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. The paper was accepted for publication in June 1969. 40 So u t h e a st e r n G e o g r a ph er application in American politics. The several major gerrymandering tech­ niques developed from this experience are summarized as follows: (1) 1. Stacked Districts—This type of gerrymandered district probably best fits the popular conception of the practice. The “stacked” district exhibits the grotesque shape that has inspired the many vivid district descriptions, as it winds its way across the landscape, seeking out pockets of voting strength of one party or interest in an overall area that is predominantly sympathetic to the opposition. Figure 1. The original gerrymander, as depicted in the Boston Gazette of March 26, 1812. The Massachusetts Legislature placed certain towns of Essex County into this odd­ shaped senatorial district in order to concentrate the Federalist vote in as few districts as possible. At firs t described as a salamander, it became known as a gerrymander because Governor Elbridge Gerry signed the redistricting bill into law. Source: Ruth C. Silva, {"}Reapportionm ent and Redistricting,” Scientific American, No. 5, November 1965, p. 21. Vol. IX, No. 2 41 2. Excess Votes.—A popular gerrymandering device is to concentrate the opposition’s vote in as few districts as possible so that it is squandered by “overkill.” Such planned landslides, also known as “packed” districts, insure safe constituencies for a party, but sacrifice votes that might be desperately needed in neighboring districts. Democrats are particularly susceptible to this technique because of the large concentration of traditionally Democratic voters in metropolitan areas. In the South, rural Democrats have “packed” districts against urban Democrats. 3. Wasted Votes.—This...},

  abstract = {Dicuil was a ninth-century Irish monk who taught at the Carolingian school of Louis the Pious. He wrote a Computus or astronomical treatise in Latin in about 814–16, which contains a chapter on triangular and square numbers. Dicuil describes two methods for calculating triangular numbers: the simple method of summing the natural numbers, and the more complex method of multiplication, equivalent to the formula n(n + 1)/2. He also states that a square number is equal to twice a triangular number minus the generating number, equivalent to n2 = 2[n(n + 1)/2] – n. The multiplication formula for triangular numbers was first explicitly described in about the third century AD by the Greek authors Diophantus and Iamblichus. It was also known as a solution to other mathematical problems as early as 300 BC. It reappeared in the West in the sixteenth century. Dicuil thus fills a gap in our medieval knowledge.},

We report age- and sex-specific deaths and injury rates from equivalent incidents in England by travel mode, distance travelled and time spent travelling.    Methods  Hospital admissions and deaths in England 2007–2009 were obtained for relevant ICD-10 external codes for pedestrians, cyclists, and car/van drivers, by age-group and sex. Distance travelled by age-group, sex and mode in England (National Travel Survey 2007–2009 data) was converted to time spent travelling using mean trip speeds. Fatality rates were compared with age-specific Netherlands data.    Results  All-age fatalities per million hours’ use (f/mhu) varied over the same factor-of-three range for both sexes (0.15–0.45 f/mhu by mode for men, 0.09–0.31 f/mhu for women). Risks were similar for men aged 21–49 y for all three modes and for female pedestrians and drivers aged 21–69 y. Most at risk were: males 17–20 y (1.3 f/mhu (95\% CI 1.2–1.4)) for driving; males 70+ (2.2 f/mhu(1.6–3.0)) for cycling; and females 70+ (0.95 f/mhu (0.86–1.1)) for pedestrians. In general, fatality rates were substantially higher among males than females. Risks per hour for male drivers \&lt;30 y were similar or higher than for male cyclists; for males aged 17–20 y, the risk was higher for drivers (33/Bn km (30–36), 1.3 f/mhu (1.2–1.4)) than cyclists (20/Bn km (10–37), 0.24 f/mhu (0.12–0.45)) whether using distance or time. Similar age patterns occurred for cyclists and drivers in the Netherlands. Age-sex patterns for injuries resulting in hospital admission were similar for cyclists and pedestrians but lower for drivers.    Conclusions  When all relevant ICD-10 codes are used, fatalities by time spent travelling vary within similar ranges for walking, cycling and driving. Risks for drivers were highest in youth and fell with age, while for pedestrians and cyclists, risks increased with age. For the young, especially males, cycling is safer than driving.},
