Description: Functions, documentation and example data to help divide
    geographic space into discrete polygons (zones).
    The package supports new zoning systems that are documented in the
    accompanying paper, 
    Lovelace et al. (2022) <doi:10.5311/JOSIS.2022.24.172>.
    The functions are motivated by research into the merits of different zoning systems
    Openshaw (1977) <doi:10.1068/a090169>. A flexible ClockBoard zoning system is
    provided, which breaks-up space by concentric rings
    and radial lines emanating from a central point.
    By default, the diameter of the rings grow according to the triangular number sequence
    Tennekes (2019) <doi:10.1080/26375451.2019.1598687> with the first 4 doughnuts
    (or annuli) measuring 1, 3, 6, and 10 km wide.
    These annuli are subdivided into equal segments (12 by default), creating the
    visual impression of a dartboard. Zones are labelled according to
    distance to the centre and angular distance from North, creating a simple
    geographic zoning and labelling system useful for visualising geographic
    phenomena with a clearly demarcated central location such as cities.
